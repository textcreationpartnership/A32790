            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous or Uncourteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHichſoever you are I value not, knowing that kind Words in a Preface are never Charms a proof to anticipate Cenſure; a Fate all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (eſpecially on ſo inconſiderable a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) cannot but expect; yet if a Brother of the Angle reads and tries, better For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune may be hoped for; as to others, the Book is not only uſeleſs, but they indiſcreet that Judge and paſs Sentence on what they underſtand not, <hi>Tractent Fabrilia Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri.</hi> The common objection I know will be raiſed by the Ignorant, that is, what needs any more Writing in this kind?
<pb facs="tcp:53504:3"/>ſince <hi>Markham, Walton, Venables, Cotton,</hi> and others, have with ſo much ingenuity beſtowed no ſmall pains herein: (to whoſe labours and industry I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg this Tract not a little beholding.) Now the old and trite Anſwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection muſt needs be return'd, that a Pigmy mounted on the Shoulders of a Giant may ſee further then its Supporter; alſo all Arts are capable of Improvement, none yet being arriv'd to an abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſome affirm, that <hi>Angling</hi> like
<hi>Mathematicks</hi> can never be ſo fully lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that there will be ſtill more new Experiments left for the Tryal of others that ſucceed; beſides thoſe Authors have diſcourſed ſomething generally on Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whereas this deſcends to the meaneſt perticular any ways relating thereunto. I purpoſely forbear to ſpeak any thing (as is uſual) in praiſe of <hi>Angling,</hi> or any ways celebrate it, by telling you what Holy and Illuſtrious perſons have been practiſers thereof, or ſpoken in its commendation: neither ſhall I ennumerate the advantages it has of other Recreations, eſpecially by the ſmallneſs of its expence, and its creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:53504:3"/>a Calm and ſedate temper of Mind; that being an unworthy way of raiſing its reputation by reflecting with detraction on other Sports, neither could I ever obſerve that Harangues of that nature ever cauſed any perſon to be enamour'd thereon, unleſs there be a natural propenſity in his own Genius thereunto, <hi>Anglers</hi> like <hi>Poets</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Born with an innate affection to <hi>Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> as <hi>Poets</hi> with an inclination to <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for this little Treatiſe many perſons have contributed much Oyl to its Lamp, elſe it would never have been able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſo great a Light; and (without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity I hope I may ſay) there are very many things herein never yet publiſhed, and not vulgarly known, as alſo all that ever has been materially Printed concerning <hi>Angling,</hi> and that in ſo conciſe, regular and brief manner deliver'd, as will not onely render this the uſefulleſt Book, but the moſt perfect of that kind. You'l find herein no vain or ſuperfluous digreſſions more apt to inflame the price, than inform the Reader. Be pleaſed to remember, That
<pb facs="tcp:53504:4"/>many of the Rules herein, are general and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſome exceptions, yet the <hi>Angler</hi> may make from thence beneficial Deductions, which if well conſider'd will diſcharge any Indictment of Falſity, the <hi>Angler</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might be incited to proſecute against me; beſides, ſomthings are propoſed for him to experiment, and not as infallible Truths; likewiſe the <hi>Countries, Soils, Rivers, Seaſons, Winds, and qualities of the Year are not alike, but differ almoſt in every place;</hi> to whoſe great variety the defect or imperfection that appears in any rule ought to be aſcribed, eſpecially in Artificial-fly-<hi>Angling:</hi> yet if the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> peruſe this Book deliberately and be but endued with conſideration and ſome Judgment to be gain'd only by practiſe, the Parent of perfection, hee'l not deny but that all things herein are ſincerely Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſo as on his own frequent Eſſays hee'l find true, and that the price of this Book is not caſt away, ſince it will in the highest degree conduce to the perfect Knowledg of the exacteſt way of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical part of this Art, for which its onely deſign'd, and not to fill or perplex the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers
<pb facs="tcp:53504:4"/>Head with Speculative, Fancyful, Idle, or fabulous notions of <hi>Fiſh</hi> or <hi>Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> The Style is plain, and fitted to the meaneſt Capacity, which I eſteemed would beſt become a Work of this Nature; neither indeed if I would, could I other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way's have done, becauſe I cannot pretend to be the Master of any Eloquence. Now, but that
'tis uſual to follow the beaten path, and that the <hi>Printer</hi> perhaps would be put out of humour, there had been no need of a Comendatory
<hi>Preface</hi> to Court any into a good opinion of it; its own Worth will abundantly juſtify the Work, which on ſerious peruſal and carefull experiments, I doubt not, but the Buyer will be ready and willing to teſtify for the Vindication as well as Satisfaction of the Author, who hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to annex his Name, not that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to own it, but wiſhes the
<hi>Reader</hi> would regard things, more than empty Names, which if all would do, many would not ſo long labour under ſuch Veils of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance as they do. Permit me therefore the common Liberty of being at this time an Anonymus, many dayly taking it for worſe Ends.</p>

After you have ſhaped your Cork, bore with a ſmall hot Iron, a hole from end to end, through the midſt thereof, into that hole thruſt a quill, and cut the Quill off even with the Cork at each End, and through the Quil draw the line, and faſten them both together with a wedg of the uppermoſt hard end of the Gooſe Quil, the feather being ſtript off, let the Wedge be two inches long, and white, which will be beſt diſcernable; then place the ſmaller end of the Cork towards the hook, and the bigger towards the rod? that the ſmaller end ſucking down with the hook, the bigger may float aloft, and bear the Wedg directly erect, which when pull'd under the furface of the Water, is the certain ſignal of the fiſhes bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

                  <head>How to Order, keep, and ſcour Worms.</head>
                  <p n="7">7. Put your Worms into very good long Moſs, whether white, red or green is not much material, but the ſoft white Moſs that grows on ſome Heaths is beſt (but it is difficult to be found in ſome Places and Countreys,) waſh it well, and cleanſe it from all earth and filth, wring it very dry, then put your Moſs and Worms into an earthen Pot, cover it cloſe that they crawl not out, ſet it in a cool place in Summer, and in Winter in a warm place, that the Froſt kill them not; every third day in Summer change the Moſs, once a week in the Winter: The longer you keep them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Log-worm, Marſh-worm and Red-worm, before you uſe them, the better: Some mingle Camomil or Fennel with the Moſs. Clean ſcowring Worms, makes them redder, clearer, tougher, ſprightlier, live long on the Hook, and keep colour, and conſequently more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by Fiſh. If you be in haſt, a little Bole armoniack put to them will further your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and make them ſcour in a ſhort time: Or you may put the Dew-worm and Red-worm 4 or 5 hours in water, and they will ſcour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but be very weak, yet a few hours in good Moſs will recover them. Then obſerve when the knot near the middle of the Brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling begins to ſwell, he's ſick, and if not well looked to, is near Death; but leſt they Die,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53504:19"/>you may ſeed them with crumbs of Bread and Milk, or fine flower and milk, or the Yolk of an Egg and ſweet Cream coagulated over the Fire; give them a little and often.</p>
                  <p>Or if you be in haſte, put your Bradlings, Gilt-tails,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> into Moſs that is exceeding wet, and it will quickly ſcour them, but not keep them long, but when you go to Angle, remove them into Moſs out of which the water is well wrung or ſqueczed.</p>
                  <p>Some wet their Moſs very well in ſweet Milk or Alewort (in which there hath been no Hops,) and then ſqueeze it pretty well, and over-night put the Worms therein they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to uſe the next day, and think Fiſh like them better; but the Worms muſt not reſt long in Moſs thus wet in Milk or Alewort; in regard it will much ſwell them, and in 24 hours ſpoil them; but if you put them in freſh Moſs and Water it will well revive them.</p>
                  <p>Others, and expert Anglers keep them in Moſs and good ſtore of Earth caſt out of a Grave; the leſs time the party hath been Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the better, and put them in freſh Moſs and ſome of this Earth when they go to Angle, and thoſe that uſe this much, boaſt of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in alluring Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>I know ſome ingenious Anglers, that in the Spring, and for a muddy water, uſe to ſhave Riddle or red Oker (with which people in
<hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire</hi> uſe to mark their Sheep) into the Moſs they keep their Worms in, and ſometimes thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53504:19"/>baits will be taken eagerly, when the brighter, (that is thoſe kept in Moſs and Water only) will not at all be taken, and perhaps within an hour again the bright ones will be taken, and the radled worms refuſed. Now ſince all ways are diſcovered to you for keeping and ordering your Worms, elect that way which Experience aſſures you to be the beſt; only this let me obſerve, That if I could otherwiſe help it I would never have my Brandlings and Gilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails kept in Moſs, and the water well ſqueezed out of it (which way I only uſe) leſs than 48 hours, or above 8 days, but I often Angle with them when they are not ſcoured above
16 hours, but 'tis not ſo good.</p>

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fiſh bite much better at the Oak-worm, or any Worm bred on Herbs or Trees, if you Angle with the ſame when they ſhew themſelves on the top of the water (as with the natural Fly) than if you uſe it under: for when a gale of wind ſhaketh the Trees, the Worms fall into the water, and preſently riſe and float on the top, where fiſh riſe at them as at Flies; and indeed they ſink not, till toſt and beaten by the Waves or Stream, and ſo they dye and loſe their native colour, and then the fiſh (as you may perceive by thoſe on your hook) value them not, although theſe ſort of Baits are taken by Roch, Dace and Chub well at the top of the Water, yet you may Angle 18 inches or lower within the water, and they

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53504:22"/>water. Sometimes you may (when you uſe a float) put on 2 or 3 together, and ſometimes Cod-bait to very great effect is joyned with a Worm, and ſometimes to an Artificial Fly to cover the point of the Hook; ſometimes its put on the point of the Hook after an Oak fly, and then they dib with it, or, which I like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to let them ſink 9 or 10 inches within the water, continually raiſing, and gently moving it. And ſome ſay Cod-balt when uſed by it ſelf is always to be Angled with at the bottom, and with the fineſt tackle, and that it is for all times of the Year the moſt holding Bait of all other whatever, both for Trout and Grayling: Others there are that affirm The beſt way to Angle with Codbait, is to Fiſh with it on the top of the water for Trout or Grayling; as you do with the Fly, and it muſt ſtand on the ſhank of the Hook, as doth the Artificial Fly (for if it come into the bent of the Hook, the Fiſh will little or not at all value it, nor if you pull the blew gut out of it) and to make it keep that place,

When any Fiſh have taken the Hook from you, if it be not ſwallowed into their Gorge, they will live, either the water will cauſe it to ruſt, and in time wear away, or the Fiſh will go to the bottom, and there root like a Hog on the Gravel, till they either rub it out, or break the Hook in the middle.</p>

The firſt Fiſh you catch, rip up his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and you may then ſee his Stomach; its known by its largeneſs and place, lying from the Gills to the ſmall Guts, take it out very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly (if you bruiſe it your labour is loſt) and with a ſharp Pen knife cut it open without bruiſing, and then you'l find his Food in it, and thereby diſcover what bait at that inſtant the Fiſh take beſt, Flyes or Ground-baits, and ſo fit them accordingly, and if you have a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Glaſs, you may (with ſome pleaſure to you) eaſily diſcover the very true colour of the Fly, and ſome can do it pretty well without a Glaſs.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Keep the Sun (and Moon if Night) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, if your eyes will endure it, at leaſt be ſure to have theſe Planets on your ſide: for if they be on your back, both your ſelf and Rod will with its ſhadow oftend much, and the Fiſh ſee further and clearer, when they look towards thoſe Lights, then the contrary; as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53504:35"/>you may experiment thus, in a dark night if a man come between you and any Light, you ſee him clearly, but not at all if the Light come betwixt you and him.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. All Fiſh whatever that ſwim in Rivers are wholeſomer, pleaſanter, and far better taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than thoſe of the ſame kind that live in Pits, Ponds, Mears and ſtanding waters.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. A Hog back and a little head, either to Trout, Salmon, or any other Fiſh, are a ſign they are in Seaſon.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Let all baits and Flyes whatſoever fall gently firſt into the Water, before any other part of the Line, and with as little of the Line as poſſible, and without any diſtubance, plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or circling of the water, which mightily ſcares Fiſh.</p>
                  <p n="16">16.

                  <p>Likewiſe let the Angler obſerve when he takes ſtore of Fiſh, the age of the Moon, the temperature of the preceeding night, and the darkneſs, brightneſs or windineſs of it, ſeaſon and nature of the morning and day, together with the temperature of the air and water, and all other precedent, concomitant, natural or adventitious advantages that could any ways conduce to his ſport, and enter them in a Book with the day of the month, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hereby with a

IN great droughts when the Rivers are ſmall, or in the heat of the day in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, although there be no drought (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept cooled by Wind, or ſhadowed by Clouds) you'l find ſmall ſport, eſpecially in marly, chalky, ſlimy, or very ſhallow and clear wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In cold froſty or ſnowy weather, or where ſtore of Snow brother is in the River, its to little purpoſe to Angle; when there happeneth in the Summer or Spring, eſpecially any ſinall hoary Froſt, all that day after the Fiſh will not riſe kindly and freely, except in the Evening and that prove pleaſant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Wind either be Eaſterly, or ſo high that you cannot guide your tools; its to little
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53504:37"/>purpoſe to Angle, for there is a ſecret malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Eaſt Wind, that generally abates the Fiſhes deſire of baits and appetito.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sharp, bitter, nipping Winds blowing from the North, but the Eaſt eſpecially, blaſt the recreation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After any ſort of Fiſh have ſpawned, they'l not bite to any purpoſe, until they have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their ſtrength and former appetite.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When any Clouds ariſe that will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring a ſhower or ſtorm (though in the midſt of Summer) they will not bite, and if they bit well before, yet at the approach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they will ceaſe biting.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the Nights prove dark, cloudy or windy, and that the Moon ſhines not at all, next day there will be little or no ſport, except at ſmall ones: For Trouts and great Fiſh then range about to devour others and ſeek Food, ſo that when the nights are dark or windy, the next day rarely proves ſucceſsful to the Angler for great Fiſh, eſpecially Trouts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In ſmall, clear and ſhallow Brooks, where the Mills ſtand and keep up the water, you will neither catch Fiſh at ground or fly at that time; for Fiſh, eſpecially Trouts, then dare not come out of their Hold.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When people waſh their Sheep in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, at the firſt time only Fiſh bite well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Filth draweth them together as to a baiting place, but after they have glutted

               <p n="1">1. IN general eſteem, the beſt hours to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in betwixt the Equinoxes, are from Sun-riſing, until half an hour after 10 a Clock and from 2 a Clock in the Afternoon until 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the day be dark, cloſe and lowring, or have a gentle whiſtling Wind playing on the water, or a fine miſling Dew of Rain falls gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly without violence, Fiſh will bite. So when Trouts leap out of the water, and Pikes ſhoot in purſuit of other Fiſhes, they will bite well, if you Angle with tackle and baits proper for the Seaſon and Fiſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Calm, clear (or which is far better) cool, cloudy weather in Summer, the Wind blowing gently, ſo as you may guide your Tools with eaſe, in the hotteſt months the cooler the better.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:53504:38"/>
               <p n="4">4. When a ſudden violent ſhower hath a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mudded and raiſed the water, then if you go forth immediately after ſuch a ſhower, and Angle at ground in the Stream or ſides thereof with Brandling, Gilt-tail, Tag-tail, or chiefly Red-worm well ſcowred; if there be ſtore of Fiſh, you'l have Sport to your own ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When Floods have carried away all the Filth that the Rain had waſhed from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grounds into the River, and that the River keepeth his uſual bounds, and is of a Whey, Cheſnut, brown, or Ale colour, then its good to Angle at ground.</p>
               <p n="6">6. After Floods are gone away, and Rivers come within their own banks, their firſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs recovered, and the water pure, then its good to Angle.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A little before any Fiſh ſpawn, they come into the gravelly, ſandy Fords to rub and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen their Bellies, and then and there they bite well.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When Rivers are raiſed by Rain, and yet are within their Banks, Fiſh ſeek ſhelter and eaſe in little and milder currents of ſmall Brooks that fall into larger Rivers, and at the ſides or ends of Bridges that defend a ſmall ſpace of ground from the impetuouſneſs of the Stream, or in any low place near the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, Fiſh reſt and ſecure themſelves from the rapid Stream, in ſuch a place not too deep, you'l find Sport.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53504:39"/>
               <p n="9">9. At the conflux of Rivers, and where it Ebbeth and Floweth, Fiſh ſometimes bite very well, in the Ebb moſt uſually, ſometimes when it floweth, rarely at full water.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In <hi>February, March,</hi> beginning of <hi>April, September,</hi> and all Winter Months, Fiſh bite beſt in the Sun ſhine, warmth and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle part of the day, no Wind ſtirring, the Air cleer; In the Summer months, mornings and evenings are beſt, and dark, windy, cool or cloudy weather: if you can guide your Tools and find ſhelter, no matter how high the Winds be, ſo they be not Eaſterly.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Fiſh riſe beſt at the Fly after a ſhower, that hath not mudded the Water, yet hath beaten the Gnats and Flyes into the River, you may in ſuch a ſhower obſerve them to riſe much, if you can but endure the Rain. The beſt Months for Fly, are <hi>March, April</hi> and
<hi>May;</hi> in cooler months, Angle in the warmth of the day, in warm weather about 9 in the morning, and 3 a clock in the afternoon, are the very chief times to Angle in, if any gentle Gale blow, ſometimes in a warm Evening, if the Gnat play much.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In calm, clear and Star-light Nights (eſpecially if the Moon ſhine) great Fiſh, Trouts eſpecially, are as wary and fearful as in dark windy days, and ſtir not, but if the next day prove cloudy and windy, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in order, you may be ſure of ſport, if there be ſtore of Fiſh in the River: for having ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53504:39"/>from food all night, they are more hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and eager, and the darkneſs and windineſs of the day makes them morebold to bite.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In ſmall clear Brooks, if you come in, or immediately after a ſhower that hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the water, or take it juſt as any Mill Water begins to come down, and ſo go along with the courſe of the water, Fiſh eſpecially Trouts, will then bite well, for then they come forth to ſeek Food, which they expect the water to bring down.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In <hi>May</hi> eſpecially, and generally all Summer, if the morning prove extream cold, as ſometimes it doth (although there be no Froſt,) Fiſh bite not to any purpoſe, until the day become warmer, and if it prove cold all the day long, they bite beſt where the Sun ſhines, but not at all in the ſhady parts of the River.</p>
               <p n="15">15. If the day be dark and cloudy in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, no matter how high the Winds be, ſo they be not Eaſterly, and you be able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage your Tools.</p>
               <p n="16">16. After the River is cleared from a Flood, Fiſh riſe very well, being glutted with ground-Baits, they then covet the Fly, having wanted it a time.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Morning and Evening are beſt for ground Line, for a Trout or other Fiſh, in clear weather and water, but in cloudy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or muddy water, you may Angle at ground all day.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:53504:40"/>
               <p n="18">18. Great Fiſh, as Trouts, feed moſt in the night, eſpecially if it be dark or windy, and then bite not next day, unleſs dark or windy it prove, and then a little in the afternoon.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The Wind blowing from the South or Weſt, is good to Angle in, the North Wind is but indifferent, but the Eaſt very bad.</p>
               <p n="20">20. All Fiſh bite keener and better, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Summer, in ſwift, rapid, ſtony Rivers, than in thoſe that run gently, and glyde on ſlime and mud.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. A Trout bites beſt in a muddy, riſing water, or in a water that is clearing after a Flood; or in dark, cloudy or windy weather, early in the morning, from a little after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, till about half an hour after ten, and from about two a clock in the afternoon till ſix, and ſometimes in the evening, but 9 a clock in the forenoon, and 3 in the afternoon, are his chiefeſt and moſt conſtant hours of biting at Ground or Fly, as the water ſuits either: <hi>March, April, May,</hi> and part of

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53504:43"/>or a little brackiſh, if you begin at the mouth of ſuch Brooks, juſt as the Tide cometh in, and goeth up the Brook, with the Head of the Tide, and return with the Ebbing of the water, you will take good Trouts, and have much ſport; and if the Tide do not muddy the water, they will alſo riſe at the Fly at ſuch a time.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Vid. Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.17. and
18.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. In ſmall clear Brooks, if you come in or immediately after a ſhower that hath raiſed the water, or take it juſt, as any Mill water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to come down, and ſo go along with the courſe of the water: Trouts will then bite well: becauſe they expect the water will bring down food with it, and they come forth to ſeek it, but in ſmall Brooks, when the Mills ſtand, and keep up the Water, you'l have little or no ſport at ground eſpecially, and but little with Fly, for the Trout at ſuch a time is fearful, and dares ſcarce venture out of hold.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. When you Angle for Salmon or Trout, and all day long have had little or rather no ſport, either at ground or fly; next night eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at the beginning of it, and until mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or near it; they will not fail to bite ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at ground or fly (as the ſeaſon or water ſuits beſt for either) freely and eagerly, if the weather be not nipping cold or froſty.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. When you Angle for Trout with fly, or ground-bait, you need not make above 3 or 4 tryals in one place: for he will then either
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53504:43"/>take it, or make an offer, or not ſtir at all.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. When Rains raiſe the Rivers, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually keep them equal with their banks or above their ordinary height; Trouts leave Rivers and larger Brooks, and fly into ſuch ſmall Brooks as ſcarce run at all in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers that are dry; in ſuch Brooks Angle for them: Trouts generally quit the great Rivers at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and go into ſmall Rills or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets to Spawn, and are frequently there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by idle, looſe and diſorderly fellows, with groping or otherwiſe; which does more injury to the breed of Fiſh than all the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Angling; for then they take all the Spawning Trouts. Thus I have known a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver very plentifully ſtored with Trouts, in 3 or 4 years utterly ſpoiled.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. When you Angle for Trout or Salmon with Worm or at ground, let your Bait drag on the ground as little as may be, but touch the ground it muſt, eſpecially for Trouts, but Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> adviſes when you Angle with a float to let the bait be as near the bottom as you can, but not drag, which perhaps may do well, but the experience of the running Line contradicts his Opinion; for therewith the bait always drags, and there is no better way at ground yet known for the catching of Trouts, than the running Line; Yet I confeſs if you Angle ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Cod-bait, Clap-bait, or water Cric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket at Float, that the bait ſwimming very near the bottom as may be, but not touching it, may do beſt.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THE Salmon is called the King of freſh water Fiſh, breeds in Rivers relating to the Sea; yet ſo high as admits of no Tincture of it; they Spawn in the end of <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> having delighted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all the Summer in the freſh water (into which he comes at Spring,) in <hi>October</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the Sea, where he lives till Spring, and grows exceeding large, but in the freſh water he only grows fat in the Summer, and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Michaelmas</hi> he chance to be ſtopt by Flood-gates or Weirs from going to Sea, and enforced to take up his Winter quarters in the freſh water, he grows ſick, lean, unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, kipper, inſipid and taſteleſs; and in one year pines away and Dies. Their Age is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 10 years, and their growth is very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den after they get into the Sea, as quickly as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53504:44"/>a Goſling becomes a Gooſe: is about 5 months out of ſeaſon after Spawning.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Salmons love large ſwift Rivers where it ebbeth and floweth; yet ſometimes they are found in leſſer Rivers high up the Country, chiefly in the latter end of the year, when they come thither to Spawn: He likewiſe delights in the ſwiſt and violent Streams, and the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gravelly Rivers, uſually with Rocks or Weeds. He ſtays not long in a place (as the Trout will,) but is ambitious ſtill to go nearer the Spring head; nor does he ly (as the Trout and many other Fiſh do) near the water ſide, or bank, or roots of Trees, but ſwims in the deep and broad parts of the Water, and uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the middle and near the ground, but the ſmall Salmon ſmelts commonly lye in the rough and upper part of a gentle Stream, and in the middle thereof.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Salmons beſt biting time is 9 a Clock in the forenoon, and 3 in the afternoon in a clear water, and when ſome wind bloweth againſt the Stream; when ſtruck he uſually falleth to plunge and leap, but does not ordinarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to run to the end of the Line, as the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53504:45"/>Trout will, young Salmons are very tender mouthed.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. For a great Salmon, the principal ground bait is the Dew-worm well ſcowred, and for the ſmall Salmon ſmelt about bigneſs of a Trout, the Brandling and Gilt-tail are the beſt ground baits. They will likewiſe take exceeding well the Bob of both ſorts, the Cod-bait and Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſe, and the counterfeit Cod-bait alſo in clear water.</p>
                  <p>For Flyes he takes the ſame that the Trout generally doth, whether natural or artificial, but the natural bait he generally takes better than the artificial fly, eſpecially by the ſmall ones.</p>
                  <p>If you put a Cod-bait or Gentle, either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or artificial, but natural better, at point of your dub-fly hook, they will take the dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly better, eſpecially the Salmon ſmelt.</p>
                  <p>Flyes made for the great Salmon, are better being made with 4 wings than with 2 only, and with 6 better than with them of 4, and if behind each pair of Wings you place a different colour for the body of the Fly, it is much the better, which argues that he loves to have ſeveral Flys on the hook at once, for the Fly looketh as if it were divers Flies together.</p>
                  <p>The Wings muſt be made ſtanding one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the other, whether 4 or 6, alſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53504:45"/>to have both body and wings of the moſt gaudy colour with long wings and tails: Silver twiſt and Gold twiſt are good to uſe in dubbing the bodies; he's caught at ground with running line or float, the bait touching, or as near the ground as poſſible, and ſometimes he bites well lower than mid-water at ground baits. He's caught with dub fly and the Cod-bait. Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bait, water-Cricket, and the counteifeit Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bait at top of the water.</p>

                  <head>How to Angle with the Running Line in a muddy water.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The running Line in a muddy water, or one diſcoloured by Rain, ſhould be half length of Rod, and the two lowmoſt links of 3 hairs a piece, then one of 4 hairs, at top whereof have a loop or waternooſe to put it to another link of four hairs, having likewiſe a water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nooſe or loop at bottom; and then proceed with 5 and 6 to the topmoſt; the 3 low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gildards ſhould be of a Sorrel, Brown or Cheſnut colour; and have a Cane-rod with a top neither too ſtiff nor too ſlender, but in a mean, and 5 yards and a half long at leaſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Line ſhould have ſo much and no more Lead than will fit the water you Angle in, <hi>viz.</hi> more in a great troubleſom, rough Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, than in a ſmaller that's quieter, as near as may be ſo much as will ſink the bait to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and permit its motion without any great heſitation, and in Angling carry the top or point of the Rod even with your hand gently downwards, (for you muſt begin at the head of the Stream) the Lead dragging and rowling on the ground, no more of the Line being in the water then will permit the Lead to touch the bottom (for you muſt keep the Line as ſtreight as poſſible, yet by no means ſo as to raiſe the Lead from the ground) and when they have bit, you'l both feel and perceive by the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53504:58"/>point of your Rod and Line, and ſtrike gently and ſtreight upwards, firſt allowing the Fiſh (by a little flackning the Line) a ſmall time to take the bait.</p>
                  <p>But ſome ſtrike at the firſt biting, but that is in a clear water for Trouts or Salmon ſmelts, which may do well: Your bait ſhould be a red-worm well ſcowred, or, which is better, a Brandling or Tagtail, or which I like beſt, both a Brandling and a Giltail on the hook at ſame time, to be baited as is hereafter directed to bait two worms to be on the hook at once: and note, that you are often to renew your bait, and generally in a muddy water I Angle with two Worms on the hook at once, as 2 Brandlings, 2 Meadow-worms or a Brandling and Giltail on the hook at once; when I Angle for Trouts unleſs I uſe the Dew-worm, a Trout takes the bait dragging on the ground, but a Grayling 9 or 12 inches from the bottom, and had rather riſe than deſcend even to a ground bait.</p>
                  <p>As for the Leading of the running Line with Plumbs, you are before taught at <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 10.11, 12.</p>

In hot weather you'l find Chubs floating near or on the top of the water; then get ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly behind ſome Tree or Buſh, ſtanding as free from motion as poſſible; let your hook hang a foot ſhort of the water, to the end you may reſt your Rod on ſome Buſh or Bough of a Tree, and the Chub in all probability will ſink down towards the bottom of the water at firſt ſight or ſhadow of the Rod, and would ſo do if a Bird fly over him, yet preſently riſes to the top again, ſoaring there till frighted again by ſome ſhadow; look out the beſt, moving your Rod as gently as a Snail to that you intend to catch, let your bait fall gently on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 5 or 6 inches before him, and he'l ſeldom refuſe the bait; you may Angle thus with Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars, Oak-worm. Aſh-fly and Cod-bait, Clap-bait, Crab-tree-worm, Waſps, young Humble Bees, Fern-flyes, Graſhopper, Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have 2 or 3 ſorts of bait on at once, as a Fern-fly, Clap-bait or Waſp, and if on ſide of a Stream let the bait ſink a foot.</p>

                  <head>Rules for Dibbing.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. You may Dib with the Green-Drake both in Streams and Stills, all hours of the day, but the Stone-fly is moſt proper for the Streams only, and that early and late, and not in the mid-time of the day: but if there be a whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Wind in the evening, Dib in the ſtill deeps with an artificial Stone-fly, where and when it will murder, and the beſt Fiſh then and there riſe, no matter how late ſo you can ſee the Fly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When you bait any ſort of Fly let your Fingers be dry, and nor wet or moiſt, leſt you ſpoil the Fly, eſpecially if tender.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Keep out of ſight if poſſible; for to Fiſh fine and far off is the great rule in all manner of Fly Angling; for if a Fiſh be coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Fly, and perceive one, he'l turn ſhort, therefore keep your Fly gently moving on top of the water as if it were alive, your ſelf out of ſight.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When you Dib for Chub, Roch, Dace, move not the Fly ſwiftly when you ſee the Fiſh coming towards it, but rather after one or two ſhort and flow removes, ſuffer the Fly to glide gently with the current towards the Fiſh, or if in a ſtanding or very ſlow water, draw the Fly flowly, not directly upon him, but ſlopeing and ſideways by him, which will make him more eager leaſt it eſcape him, for if you move
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53504:66"/>it nimbly and quick, they will not (being Fiſh of flow motion, follow as the Trout will.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When Chub, Roch and Dace ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the top of the water on a Sun-ſhine day, they are eaſily caught with baits proper for them, and you may almoſt chooſe from amongſt them which you pleaſe to take.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Chub, Roch and Dace ſometimes take an artificial fly with a Cod-bait, Oak-worm or a Clap-bait at point of the hook, and the Oak-worm when they ſhew themſelves, is full as good on the top of the water as under, or then the Fly it ſelf, and more deſired by them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Trouts, Graylings and Salmon Smelts will take an Artificial Fly very well at Dibbing, particularly beſt the Green-Drake, and likewiſe the Stone-fly early or late in the evening, and if you could but hit the colour of the Oak-fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and joyn a Cod-bait either natural or artificial, there would be no need of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Oak-fly; if you Dib for Salmon ſmelts with the Dub-fly, put on a Cod-bait, Clap-bait or Gentle at point of the hook.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In a calm you will not have ſo much ſport even with Dibbing, as in a whiſtling gale of Wind, both becauſe you then are not ſo eaſily diſcover'd by the Fiſh, and alſo then but few Flies can lye on the water, for where they have ſo much choice they will not be ſo eager and forward to riſe at a bait, that both the ſhadow of your body, rod, nay very line, in a hot, calm day, will in ſpite of your beſt caution, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53504:67"/>ſuſpected to them, but even then in ſwift Streams with the Green-Drake or Stone-fly, by ſitting patiently behind a buſh you may do exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. All Fiſh take the Fly ſometimes beſt on top of the water at another time much better a little under the ſuperficies of the water, therefore if they will not riſe at the top, try them a little under, but Chub, Roch and Dace will frequently take the Fly within water.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Fiſh never eagerly riſe at any Fry until that kind come to the Rivers ſide, which all Flies do before they die to moiſten their wings, and from the buſhes and herbs skip and play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water, where they are ſnapt up by the Fiſh.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To know what Flies Fiſh take, beat on the Buſhes on the Rivers bank, and ſee what Fly falls and Fiſh take beſt, and that uſe, <hi>vid. cap. 7 ſect.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.

               </head>
               <p>NOW I ſhall treat of artificial, Dab-fly or Caſt-fly Angling (for ſo its ſtiled in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places) and herein I find it no ſmall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty by written directions perfectly (altho' I ſhall attempt it) to teach any (tho as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53504:67"/>as may be) how to make an artificial or dub-fly, therefore the beſt and readieſt way is to procure ſome skilful Fly Angler to let you ſee one made, and by obſerving the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules, and then your own Experience and Obſervations in a ſhort time will make you a perfect Artiſt. The great difficulty is to obtain the right colour of the Fly Fiſh then take, which none can make a general deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, becauſe ſeveral Rivers and Soils produce ſeveral and divers Flies, as the Moſſy and Boggy have one ſort particular to them, the Clay, Gravelly and Mountainous Country and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others; and the mellow light Soil diſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from them all; but much earlier in ſome places than others, nay in
<hi>Wales</hi> and other Countreys there are peculiar Flies proper to the particular place and Country: And my own Experience has abundantly ſatisfied me, that almoſt in every River the Flies vary in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, kind, ſhape or proportion, and that in all places the ſame Flies are taken much earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ſome Rivers and Years than others; nay, in the very ſame River and Year I have known the Stone-fly taken a month earlyer at 5 or 6 miles diſtance lower than higher up the ſame River; therefore the Angler having obſerved and found the Fly Fiſh moſt affect at the very preſent time, let him make one as like it as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he can in colour, ſhape and proportion of body and wings, and for his better imitation, let him lay the natural Fly before him, and try
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53504:68"/>near art can come unto, or diſſemble nature by an equal ſymetry and commixture of colors. The better to attain which end, the Angler muſt always have in readineſs a large Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine Bag or Budget, plentifully furniſhed with the following materials.</p>

                  <head>Rules for Dub-flies and its Angling.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. In making Dub-ſties chiefly obſerve and imitate the Belly of the Fly, for that colour Fiſh moſt take notice of, as being moſt in their eye, and let the Wings of the Fly always be of an equal length, elſe the Fly will not ſwim right and true.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When you try how to fit the colour of the Fly, wet the Dubbing leſt you be miſtaken; for although when dry, they exactly ſuit the colour of the Fly, yet the water alters moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and will make them brighter or darker.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Always make your Dub-flies on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine day, and to know the exact colour of your Dubbing, hold the ſame betwixt your eye and the Sun, and you'l far better diſcover the true colour of the Dubbing, then only by looking on it in the hand in the houſe, dark day or a ſhady place.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Never let the tail of the Dub-fly deſcend lower than until you come to the bend of the

                  <p n="5">5. When Trouts often ſhew themſelves at your Fly, and yet do not take it, be aſſured that either the day or water is improper for Fly, or which is far more probable, your Dub-fly is not of the right colour of ſhape they then cover.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Some always adviſe to Dub with Silk of the moſt predominant colour of the Fly, but we generally dub Duns with yellow Silk, and our Browns with red Silk, and at <hi>September</hi> with Violet Silk, or Horſe-fleſh coloured Silk.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Flies made of the hair of Bears, Hogs, Squirrels tail, Camels, Dogs, Foxes Badgers, Cows, Calves skins tewed; abortive Calves and abortive Colts skins tewed, out landiſh Cadows are more natural, lively, and keep colour bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the water, then Flies made of Crewels and many ſort of Worſted Stuffs which are of a dead and dull colour in the water.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The feather got from the quill of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtare, Stare or Starlings wing is the beſt Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generally to be uſed in dubbing, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Drake feather.</p>

                  <p n="10">10. When you Angle with Dub-fly it muſt be in a River either clear, or almoſt clear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rain, or in a Mooriſh River diſcoloured by Moſs or Bogs, or elſe in a dark, cloudy day, when a gentle gale of Wind moves the water, but if the Wind be high, yet ſo as you may guide your tools, they will riſe well in the plain Deeps, and then and there you'l commonly kill the beſt-Fiſh, but if the Wind be little or none at all, you muſt Angle in the ſwife Streams.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Keep your Dub-fly in continual motion, tho' the water or day be dark or wind blow, otherwiſe tho Fiſh will diſcern and refuſe it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Angling in Rivers diſcoloured by Rain or paſſing through Moſſes or Bogs or if the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be dark or very full, uſe a larger bodyed Fly than ordinary.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. If the water be clear and low, uſe a ſmall bodyed Fly with ſlender Wings.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. If the day be clear, uſe a light coloured Fly with ſlender body and wings.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. In dark weather as well as dark water, the Fly muſt be dark.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. As Summer approaches and water clears, Flies generally are made ſmaller and brighter.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. When you Angle with Dub-fly, your Rod ſhould be no leſs than 5 yards and half long, and the line twice ſo long, unleſs the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be encumbred with Wood or Trees.</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:53504:73"/>
                  <p n="18">18. Same adviſe for every Fly to have 3, one of a lighter colour, another ſadder, and a third the exact colour of the natural Fly, by which means you may the better adapt them to the colour of the Water and Sky.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Fiſh rarely take the Dub-fly in any flow River, whoſe bottom or ground is ſlime or mud; for in great droughts Fiſh bite but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in any Rivers, but nothing in ſlimy Rivers whoſe Mud is not cool'd by the ſwiftneſs of the Currant, but in ſandy, gravelly, ſtony or rapid Rivers, you may catch Fiſh at that time.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. You muſt have a quick eye, a nimble Rod and Hand, and ſtrike with the riſing of the Fiſh, or they find their miſtake, and putteth out the hook again; others are of Opinion never to offer to ſtrike a good Fiſh, if he do not ſtrike himſelf, till firſt you ſee him turn his head after he has taken the Fly, and then ſay they, The tackle will not ſtrain in ſtriking, if moderately you ſtrike.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. When you caſt the Fly, wave the Rod with a ſmall circumſerence about your head, elſe the Fly will be apt to jeck or ſnap off.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. When you ſee a Trout riſe, caſt the Fly behind him, and then gently draw it over his head, and, if of the right colour, you ſcare him not, he's your own.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. In caſting the Fly do it always before you, ſo that the Fly may firſt fall upon the water (otherwiſe it will ſcare the Fiſh,) and as little of the Line with it as poſſible, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53504:73"/>without circling the water, though, if the wind be ſtiff, you will then be compelled to drown a great part of the line to keep the Fly in the water, and endeavour to have the Wind on your back, and Sun in your face if you can, but the windings and turnings of the River will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that impoſſible.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. When you Angle in ſlow Rivers or ſtill places with the Dub-fly, caſt your Fly ever croſs the River, and let it ſink a little in the water, and draw him gently back again, ſo as you break not the water, or raiſe any circles or motions thereon, and let the current of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver carry the Fly gently down with the Stream, and this is the beſt way in ſlow, ſlimy bottom Rivers for the Dub-fly.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Stand always as far off the bank as the line will give leave; for to Fiſh fine and far off is the great Rule in Fly Angling.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. In Froſt and Snow, or exceſſive cold weather in the Spring, Angle with the ſmalleſt Gnats, Browns and Duns you can make.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. For ſtony, clear, cryſtalline Rivers, Flies generally are made with ſlender body and wings, but in dark, diſcoloured and full wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. When you know not certainly what Fly is taken, or cannot ſee Fiſh riſe, then put on a ſmall Hackle, if the water be clear, but bigger, if ſomething dark, until you have taken one, then order the matter as you are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>cap. 7. ſect.</hi> 11.</p>

                  <p>TRowling for Pike is very pleaſant, and the Trowl may be bought ready made, only let it have a Winch to wind it up withal.</p>

                  <head>Trowlidg tackle.</head>
                  <p>For this Fiſh your tackle muſt be ſtrong, your Rod muſt not be very ſlender at the top, where you muſt place a ſmall ſlender ring for your Line to run through. Let your Line be Silk for at leaſt 2 yards next the hook, and the reſt 4 or 6 folds of the very beſt and neatlieſt ſpun Hemp Yarn and curiouſly twiſted 16

<note place="margin">How to bait the Pike hook.</note> then with a Probe or Needle you muſt draw the wire in at the Fiſhes mouth and out at his tail, that ſo the hook may lye in the mouth of the Fiſh, and both the points on either ſide; upon the ſhank of the hook faſten ſome Lead very ſmooth, that it go into the Fiſhes mouth and ſink her with the head downwards; as though ſhe had been playing on the top of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and were returning to the bottom, your bait may be Gudgeon, Menow, ſmall Trout, ſmall Roch or Dace, ſmall Salmon ſmelts, Perch, his upper moſt back-fins cut off, Loach or ſometimes a Frog, your hook thus baited, you muſt tye the tail of the Fiſh cloſe and faſt to the Wire, or elſe with drawing to and again, the Fiſh will rend off the hook, or which is neater, with a Needle and ſtrong Thread ſtitch through the Fiſh on either ſide of the Wire, and tie it very faſt.</p>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53504:84"/>(as you may perceive) with the head, ſwallowing that firſt, thus let him lie until you ſee the line move in the water, and then you may certainly conclude he hath pouched the bait, and ranged abroad for more, then with the Trowl wind up your Line (which ſhould always be 16 or 18 yards long at leaſt) till you think you have it almoſt ſtreight, then with a ſmart jerk hook him, and make your pleaſure to your content.</p>
                  <p>Some uſe no Rod at all, but holding the Line on links on their hand, uſing Lead and Float.</p>
                  <p>Others uſe a very great Hook with the Hook at the tail of the Fiſh, and when the Pike cometh they ſtrike at the firſt pull.</p>
                  <p>Others uſe to put a ſtrong String or Thread in at the month of the bait and out at one of the gills, and ſo over the head, and in at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gills, and ſo tye the bait to the hook, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a little length of Thread or String be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Fiſh and Hook, that ſo the Pike may turn the head of the bait the better to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, and then as before, after ſome pauſe ſtrike.</p>
                  <p>Some uſe to tie the bait hook and line to a bladder or bundle of Flags or Bullruſhes, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the line very gently in the cleft of a ſmall ſtick, to hold the bait from ſinking more than (its allowed length) half a yard, and the ſtick muſt be faſtned to the Bladder or flags, to which the Line being tied, that it might eaſily unfold and run to its length, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53504:85"/>ſo give the Pike liberty to run away with the bait, and by the Bladder or Flags recover their Line again; you muſt obſerve this way to turn off your Bait with the Wind or Stream that they may carry it away, or ſome uſe (for more ſport, if the Pike be a great one, and in a Pond) to tie the ſame to the foot of a Gooſe, which the Pike if large will ſometimes pull under water.</p>

                  <head>Angling for Pike at Snap.</head>
                  <p>When you Fiſh for the Pike at Snap, you muſt give him leave to run a little, then ſtrike, but be ſure ſtrike the contrary way to that which he runneth; a double Spring hook is principally if not only uſeful in this way of Angling, and much to be preferred before all other hooks, for the Pike will uſually hold the bait ſo faſt in his Teeth that you may fail to pull it out of his mouth and alſo ſtrike him, whereas with a Spring hook though he hold it never ſo faſt, the Wire will draw through the bait, and ſo the Spring will open, and you will very frequently hook him on the out-ſide of his mouth: Angling with the Trowl is a furer at leaſt a more eaſy way for a Learner to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe (who wants an inſtructer) than the Snap, beſides the Snap is chiefly uſeful to take a Pike, which often pricking with the Trowl hath made wary and cunning (for one that hath not been ſcared will ſwallow the bait boldly) ſuch an one is taken beſt at Snap.</p>

                  <p>In this way of Angling, put on your bait thus, make a hole with the point of your Hook or Probe in the Fiſhes ſide as near the middle as you can, put in your armed wire, and draw it out at the mouth, and with a Needle and Thread ſew up the Fiſhes mouth.</p>
                  <p>Others uſe the Probe to draw the arming wire under the skin only (not the Ribs by any means) and out at the bone behind the gills, then again under the gills &amp; our at the mouth: this latter way is much better, becauſe there is only the skin to hinder the drawing and piercing of the hook, whereas the former way, if the Pike hold faſt (as commonly he doth) all the Fleſh on the out-fide of the Fiſh will be drawn into a heap or lump, ſo thick that the hook (except very large) can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p n="5">5. At Snap you muſt give 2 luſty Jerks one after the other, and be ſure you ever ſtrike contrary to the way his head lieth, leſt you pull the bait from him only.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Faſten your ſwivel to the end of your Line, and hook your armed Wire upon the Swivel.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For the Snap caſt a piece of lead hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and ſo wide as to go over the wire and the end of the hook, which you draw within the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="8">8. Both at Snap and with Trowl cut away one of the Fins cloſe at the gills, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the vent, another on the contrary ſide, the bait will play better.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. In caſting with Trowling or at Snap, be ſure to raiſe your hand a little when you ſee the bait ready to fall into the water, this will prevent that the bait daſh not violently into the water in its fall, which affrights the Pike (tho he be a bold Fiſh) when it falls behind and near unto him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Make your Lead for the Trowl four ſquare, and much thicker and ſhorter than
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53504:86"/>moſt uſe, the ſquare will keep the hook in the ſame place as you ſet it, and the thick ſhort Lead, ſinks him with his head downwards, ſo that he will not ſhoot ſloopwiſe, as he doth when the Lead is long.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Join your wire links together with a Steel Ring, the bait will play and ſink better, if it lye only in the baits mouth, it will not entangle in the line ſo often.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. A larger bait doth more invite the Pike, but a leſſer takes him more ſurely, as ſooneſt gorged, and the hook cortainly taken into his mouth both at Snap and Trowl.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Uſe a large white Menow put on with the hook in his mouth, Angle with him for a Pike, as you do for a Trout, and let your hook be ſmall, uſe not a great hook with a ſmall bait.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Plant Willowes or Alders about it, and caſt in ſome Faggots in ſandy places, not far from the ſide for Fiſh to Spawn on, and defend their Spawn and young Fry from Ducks, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Frogs and Vermin; eſpecially the Spawn of Carp and Tench.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Contrive the Pond ſo as the water may be continually renewed by ſome Rill or Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, which inclines Fiſh both to breed and feed better, and makes them be of a better and pleaſanter taſte: So Pools that are large have gravelly bottoms and ſhallows for Fiſh to ſport themſelves on, make them purely taſted, ſo hollow banks, ſhelves, roots of Trees, preſerves them from their Enemies, and Shades defend them in Summer from heat, and in Winter from cold. But many Trees growing about the Pond is ill for Fiſh; becauſe the falling and rotting of the leaves makes the water ſtink and ſowr, and the Fiſh ill taſted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Carp loves gravelly, ſtony, ſandy grourd and breed beſt in Marle Pils, or Pits that have

               <p n="5">5. Often feed the Fiſh by throwing into them Chippings of Bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

So Garden Earth and Parſly thrown into a Pond, recovers and refreſhes ſick Fiſh. When you ſtore a breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pond, put in 2 or 3 Males for one Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mole, but in a ſeeding Pond take no care whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be more Males or Female Carps; others, and more rationally, adviſe to put in two Females for one Male into the breeding Pond.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Carps and Tench thrive and breed beſt when no other Fiſh is but with them into the ſame Pond, for all other Fiſh devour their Spawn.</p>

In Winter break the Ice, if a great Froſt, and make ſeveral holes in the Ice, for Fiſh to breath at, and throw Bean-ſtraw into the Pond, if you ſuſpect a hard Froſt to approach, and kill and deſtroy all Herons, Seaguis, King Fiſhers, Water-Coots, Water-Rats, Water-Mice, Bltterns, and Otters that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Pond, and ſuffer not much Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Wild-fowl; for that affrightens, harms, and deſtroys Fiſh.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53504:89"/>the moſt dilicate Fiſh, not onely ingrateful to the Palate, but even nauſeous to the Stomach; to obviate which inconvenience, I will here furniſh the Angler (out of Mr. <hi>Walton,</hi> inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and others) what the eaſieſt, and beſt ways of dreſſing freſh water Fiſh; ſo that upon ſuch ſtreſs, he may direct his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady ſo well, as (if ſhee'l obſerve him) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhame her ſelf, nor ſpoil a good Diſh of Fiſh; and I will firſt teach you how to dreſs the Chub: he being a Fiſh that has loſt much reputation for want of good dreſſing.</p>

Firſt ſcale him, and then waſh him clean, and take out his Guts, and to that end, make the hole little and as near to his Guils you may conveniently, and eſpecially make clean his Throat from Graſs and Weeds that are uſual in it (for if that be not clean it will make him taſt ſowr) having ſo done, put ſome ſweet herbs into his Belly, and then tye him with a or 3 ſplinters to a Spit, and roaſt him, baſted often with Vinegar, or rather Verjuice and Butter, with good ſtore of Salt mixt with it. This way drys up the fluid watry humor with which all Chubs do abound. A Tench may be thus dreſt like wiſe.</p>

Dreſt in this manner, the watry taſt is taken away for which many except againſt him: they are to be eaten the ſame day they are caught, and forget not to waſh his Throat very clean, and his Body muſt not be waſhed after gutted; as indeed no Fiſh ſhould be, but wiped clean with a linnen cloath.
